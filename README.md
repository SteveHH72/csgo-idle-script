# csgo-idle-script

With this script you are able to take a short break from the game without being kicked. 
So when you are called to dinner you start the script and your character moves the whole time until you stop the script again. 

The script is very simple - you only need Access to the "Terminal" in CSGO. 

Insert the 2 Lines in the Console. After inserting the 2 Lines you can switch it on with "IDLEon" or switch it off with "IDLEoff". 

The Script includes a part to disable the Motd so the script can run hours, days, weeks, ... ;-) 


P.S.: You can also insert the Script in your autoexec.cfg !
