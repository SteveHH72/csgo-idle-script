# csgo-idle-script

with this script you are able to take a short break from the game without being kicked. 
So when you are called to dinner you start the script and your character moves the whole time until you stop the script again. 

The script is very simple - you only need Access to the "Terminal" in CSGO: 

<open console>

Write this two lines in the console: 

alias IDLEon "+forward; +moveleft; +left; cl_disablehtmlmotd 1; echo csgo-idle-script by SteveHH - [Enabled]"




If you want use this Script simple type "IDLEon" if you have to leave, if you are back type "IDLEoff" and you can play like before.

This script let your Charakter turn round and round at the same place - also it disables the Motd so it can run hours and days ^^ 

P.S.: You can also put this script in your autoexec.bat
